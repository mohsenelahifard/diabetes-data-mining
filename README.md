# Diabetes Classification and Clustering Project 

This project demonstrates a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing and modeling a diabetes dataset, focusing on both supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) learning techniques. The notebook includes custom implementations, visualizations, and detailed evaluations to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Features üí°

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and addressing null values.
- **Outlier Detection**: Managing anomalies in the data.
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical data to numerical forms.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

- **Distributions**: Visualizing the spread of key features.
- **Feature Insights**: Understanding correlations and relationships.

### 3. Classification 

- **Decision Tree (ID3)**: Custom implementation of a decision tree with entropy and information gain.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A distance-based algorithm with configurable hyperparameters.

### 4. Clustering 

- **K-Means Clustering**: Custom implementation with elbow method visualization.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Step-by-step clustering with dendrogram plots.

### 5. Visualization 

- **Tree Structures**: Displaying decision trees with annotations.
- **Cluster Plots**: Intuitive 2D visualizations for grouped data.
- **Dendrograms**: Hierarchical clustering representation.

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

## Usage üîß

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook diabetes_mining_source.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook sections to:

   - Preprocess the data.
   - Apply classification algorithms (Decision Tree and KNN).
   - Perform clustering using K-Means and Hierarchical approaches.

4. Visualize results and interpret the output.

## Key Results üìä

- **Classification Metrics**: High accuracy achieved with Decision Tree and KNN on the test dataset.
- **Clustering Insights**: Clear cluster separations observed, aligning with the elbow and dendrogram methods.
